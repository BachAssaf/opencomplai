"""
Health endpoint tests for egress-proxy.

``/health`` here is not a self-liveness probe: it proxies a real request to
``GATEWAY_API_URL`` and mirrors the gateway's answer. The previous version of
this file called it with no mocking, so it made an actual network request and
returned 503 whenever a gateway was not running — a permanent failure in the
documented baseline (see PLAN/execution/BLOCKERS.md) that said nothing about
the code under test.

The outbound call is now mocked, the way ``test_dlp.py`` already avoids real
egress, and both branches are covered. ``/egress-health`` — the endpoint that
reports this service's own liveness, and the one gateway-api probes for exactly
that reason (OPS-HEALTH) — is covered directly.
