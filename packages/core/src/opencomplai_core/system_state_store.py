"""
Persistence for the HITL deployment state machine (HALT-WIRE).

`state_machine.transition()` computes the *rule* for a state change — it is
pure and takes no dependency on storage. This module is the one place that
reads/writes the *fact* of a system's current state to disk: a single JSON
file, keyed by `system_id`, so multiple systems tracked by the same
Opencomplai install stay independently halted/running.

No service dependency today — the CLI (`opencomplai check` / `approve` /
`resume` / `docs generate`) is the only caller (E-12), so callers choose
where the file lives (the CLI passes its own config directory, overridable
via `OPENCOMPLAI_STATE_DIR` for tests/CI).
